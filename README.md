# DataScience Portfolio

This project portfolio aims to demonstrate the concept of data used in datascience. It is to test the knowledge of the purpose of datasets, discover common patterns and ultising predicting models with machine learning to achieve accurate results and determine the overall solutions to a given problem.

Most of the portfolios explores the concept of cybersecurity and IT relate topics.

## Portfolio Task
* Data cleaning.
  * Removing null values and empty columns from datasets.
  * Providing data summarization of the numbers of unique values and the descriptive statistics of each columns (Mean, Min, Max and Standard deviation).
  * Visualising the data using appropiate histogram and boxplot with the clean dataset.
  * Removing potential outliers.

* Implementing Train Split Test for linear regression model.
  * Reusing the clean dataset by exporting.
  * Converting the Catergorical values into numerical values for appropriate values to desired correlations.
  * Implemtenting a train test split for four models in regards column.
 
* Implementing both a Logistic regression model and K-Nearest Neighbor model.
  * Implementing a Logistic regression model.
  * Implementing a K-Nearest Neighbor model.
  * Comparing which model has a higher performance. 
  * Using feature selection to determine which is the best or worst feature for our model.
